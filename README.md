# MobileHub
MobileHub is a work-in-progress GitHub Client Android application, that connects to [GitHub GraphQL APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).
This is not an official GitHub Client.

## Languages/Frameworks Used:
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

## Development Setup:
First of all, you will need the latest [Android Studio Arctic Fox](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) release to be able to 
build the app. This is because the project is written in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

### Code Style:
This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint), provided via the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) gradle plugin.
